# Greybots Signin Apps Scripts

This folder holds required apps scripts to be used on The Greybots' Team Roster.

## Usage

Every year when we make a new roster, make sure to copy the .gs files from here to the Google Sheets' script editor. Replace the legacy token with the one in the Firebase Console.
